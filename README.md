=================

This repository provides Dockerfiles used

CSDMS maintains a GitHub repository of
Dockerfiles used to build Docker images
used by CSDMS.  Dockerfiles contained in this
repository fall into one or more of the
following categories:

* They provide the basic tools used to build
  the CSDMS Software Stack. This includes
  particular versions of compilers (gcc,
  gfortran, etc.) and particular versions of
  operating systems.
* They provide images of the complete
  CSDMS Software Stack built (and tested) on
  various operating systems with a range
  of compilers.
* Images to be deployed that either run
  the CSDMS execution server, or the WMT server.
* General purpose images used by CSDMS or that
  the CSDMS community may find useful.
